## Tensorflow RNN prototypes

Working on getting variable length RNN running. 
Mnist working example ripped from blog post at:
http://danijar.com/variable-sequence-lengths-in-tensorflow/

Python 3.5 is mandatory, due to package `sets` requirements. this can be done with conda by,
```
to activate py35 run 
    conda create -n py35 python=3.5 anaconda
    source activate py35
    # source deactivate py35
```
Also remember to,
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install sets
```
